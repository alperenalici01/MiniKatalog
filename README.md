  Mini Katalog + Flutter

This project provides a minimalist setup for a mobile product catalog application developed with Flutter.

It features a clean UI with product listings, category filtering, and a modern card-based layout.

Currently, the project leverages the following technologies:



Dart for the core application logic and UI components.

Kotlin for Android platform-specific integration and embedding.

  Development Environment

The application is designed to be developed and tested using Android Studio.

It includes a pre-configured layout for displaying products (e.g., Electronics, Accessories) and pricing, optimized for Android devices.

  Expanding the Application

If you are developing a production-ready application, we recommend integrating robust state management and backend services.



State Management: For complex interactions (like a functional shopping cart), consider implementing Riverpod or BLoC.
